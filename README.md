# NodeJS_Learning
This repository contains practical examples and foundational concepts I’m learning while working with Node.js.

What’s Covered

- Creating basic HTTP servers
- File system operations
- Working with modules
- Handling asynchronous operations (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Error handling and clean code structure

Each folder represents a specific topic with a focused code example.  
This repo is intended both for personal revision and as a reference for others learning Node.js.


What is NodeJs?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server side.
It's built on Google’s V8 engine, uses non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O, and is perfect for building fast and scalable applications like APIs, real-time chat apps, or servers.
